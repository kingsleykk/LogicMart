## Database Execution Required
**Important**: Run the SQL script to apply database changes:
```sql
-- Execute remove_customer_dependency.sql in your Supabase/PostgreSQL database
```

## Testing Status
✅ System starts without errors
✅ Database connection verified
✅ CSV format updated
✅ Help documentation updated
✅ Sample data file updated

## Next Steps
1. Execute the SQL script in your database
2. Test CSV upload functionality with new format
3. Verify analytics dashboard works correctly
4. Update any external documentation or training materials

The system is now significantly simplified and should be much easier to use and maintain!
